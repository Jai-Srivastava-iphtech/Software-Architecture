# üèóÔ∏è Software Architecture ‚Äì Summary & Correlation

## üìò What is Software Architecture?

**Definition:**
Software Architecture is the high-level blueprint of a software system that defines its **structure, components, relationships, and design principles**.

**Purpose:**
It ensures **scalability, maintainability, and efficiency**, and helps teams communicate effectively.

**Analogy:**
Like a **building‚Äôs blueprint**, it shows how all parts (components) fit together for a stable and functional system.

---

## 1. Layered Architecture (N-Tier)

**Concept:**
Application divided into horizontal layers, each with a specific role (UI, logic, data).

**Common Layers:**

* Presentation (UI/UX)
* Application (Workflows)
* Business Logic (Rules/Entities)
* Data Access (Database/API)

**Analogy:** Multi-story building ‚Äî each floor has a clear purpose.
<br/>**Pros:** Modular, maintainable, testable.
<br/>**Cons:** Performance overhead, rigid structure.
<br/>**Use When:** Small to medium systems prioritizing structure.

---

## 2. Client-Server Architecture

**Concept:**
Clients send requests; a central server processes and responds.

**Analogy:** Restaurant ‚Äî customers (clients) order food; the kitchen (server) prepares it.
<br/>**Pros:** Centralized control, easy updates, scalable.
<br/>**Cons:** Single point of failure, server load.
<br/>**Use When:** Web and mobile applications.

---

## 3. Microservice Architecture

**Concept:**
System divided into many **small, independent services**, each with its own logic and data.

**Analogy:** Shopping mall ‚Äî many small stores, each handling one thing.
<br/>**Pros:** Independent deployment, scalability, flexibility.
<br/>**Cons:** Complex management, network overhead.
<br/>**Use When:** Large, complex, scalable systems.

---

## 4. Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)

**Concept:**
Components communicate via **events** instead of direct calls.

* **Event-Driven Design:** Real-time event listening.
* **Message-Driven Design:** Uses brokers like RabbitMQ or Kafka.

**Analogy:** Notification system ‚Äî parts react when an event occurs.
<br/>**Pros:** Scalable, loosely coupled, asynchronous.
<br/>**Cons:** Debugging and data consistency challenges.
<br/>**Use When:** Real-time systems (chat, IoT, e-commerce).

---

## 5. Model-View-Controller (MVC)

**Concept:**
Splits application into:

* **Model** ‚Üí Data & Logic
* **View** ‚Üí UI
* **Controller** ‚Üí Bridge between Model & View
<br/>**Analogy:** Waiter (Controller) connects customers (View) with chef (Model).
<br/>**Pros:** Clear separation, testable, reusable.
<br/>**Cons:** Overhead for small apps.
<br/>**Use When:** Web or GUI applications.

---

## 6. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)

**Concept:**
App divided into independent **services** communicating via APIs (HTTP/SOAP).
<br/>**Analogy:** Restaurant kitchen ‚Äî each chef (service) has a role.
<br/>**Pros:** Reusability, interoperability.
<br/>**Cons:** Complex setup, possible performance issues.
<br/>**Use When:** Enterprise or distributed systems.

---

## 7. Repository Pattern

**Concept:**
Acts as a **middle layer** between the app and the database.
<br/>**Analogy:** Library counter ‚Äî request a book (data) without touching the shelves.
<br/>**Pros:** Cleaner data handling, easier testing.
<br/>**Cons:** Overhead for small projects.
<br/>**Use When:** Projects needing maintainable data access.

---

## 8. CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

**Concept:**
Separates **read (Query)** and **write (Command)** operations for performance.
<br/>**Analogy:** Two counters ‚Äî one for ordering, one for checking status.
<br/>**Pros:** Scalable, fast, organized.
<br/>**Cons:** Complex setup, temporary inconsistencies.
<br/>**Use When:** High-traffic systems (e-commerce, banking).

---

## 9. Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

**Concept:**
Focuses on **business domain understanding** and maps real-world processes to code.
<br/>**Analogy:** City map ‚Äî each area (context) has its own rules.
<br/>**Pros:** Modular, aligned with business needs.
<br/>*Cons:** Complex and time-consuming.
<br/>**Use When:** Large, business-critical systems.

---

## 10. Pipes and Filters Pattern

**Concept:**
Data flows through a series of **filters** connected by **pipes**, each processing sequentially.
<br/>**Analogy:** Water filter ‚Äî each layer cleans or transforms the data.
<br/>**Pros:** Modular, scalable, reusable.
<br/>**Cons:** Overhead in long pipelines.
<br/>**Use When:** Data pipelines, ETL, media processing.
